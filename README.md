Make sure you download the needed NuGet packages:
- HtmlAgilityPack
- Newtonsoft.Json
- ReaLTaiizor
- Selenium.Support
- Selenium.WebDriver
- Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver
- SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers

  If you want to just use the tool all you need to do is run the .exe end all instances, in case you have anything running in the background, and boom you can run multiple instances of Roblox.com games.
